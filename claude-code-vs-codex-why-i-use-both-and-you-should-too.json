Attached is how the subscribe form looks like.”\n\n\n\n\n\nCodex immediately went into detective mode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodex immediately went into detective mode, analyzing every aspect:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The Meticulous Review Results\n\n\n\n\nAfter thorough analysis, Codex identified several critical issues that Claude Code missed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Codex Found:\n\n\n\n\nSecurity Gap: The shortcode form lacked nonce and honeypot protection\n\nNo wp_nonce_field in the shortcode form\n\n\n\n- Template had security features, but shortcode didn’t use them\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration Issues:\n\n- Shortcode posted to wrong endpoint\n\n\n\n\n- AJAX handler expected different parameters\n\n\n\n\n- JS selector wouldn’t catch all form variants\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation Mismatches:\n\n- PHP usage example was incorrect\n\n\n\n\n- Guide showed wrong template path syntax\n\n\n\n\n- Style parameter documentation was misleading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall but Important Details:\n\n- Footer template had a stray “◆” character instead of proper close icon\n\n\n\n\n- Hidden context field missing for non-JS submissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            \n                            \n## \n                    Want techniques like these weekly?                \n\n                        \n                            \n                    Join The Art of Vibe Coding—short, practical emails on shipping with AI (without the chaos).                \n\n\n                    \n    \n    \n                \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n            Subscribe        \n    \n\n    \n            \n            No spam.

Seriously.        \n\n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\nPhase 3: Applying the Fixes (With a Twist)\n\n\n\nHere’s where I made an interesting choice. \n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of taking Codex’s recommendations back to Claude Code, I asked Codex itself to apply the fixes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did I choose Codex over Claude Code for the fixes? \n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to test if Codex could handle implementation as well as review. \n\n\n\n\n\nSpoiler: it absolutely can.\n\n\n\nCodex methodically applied each improvement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: You could absolutely ask Claude Code to apply these fixes instead. Both approaches work. The choice depends on your workflow preference and which tool already has the most context about your specific requirements.\n\n\n\n\n## The Final Result\n\n\n\n\nThe difference was night and day:\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore Codex Review: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Codex Review: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final implementation now included:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- ✅ Full security with nonce + honeypot\n\n\n\n\n- ✅ Proper AJAX/REST integration\n\n\n\n\n- ✅ Consistent styling across all contexts\n\n\n\n\n- ✅ Accurate documentation\n\n\n\n\n- ✅ Clean UI with proper icons\n\n\n\n\n- ✅ Hidden context field for fallback\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The Workflow That Changes Everything\n\n\n\n\nHere’s my exact process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 1: Initial Implementation with Claude Code\n\n\n\n\n\"Build [feature] following our project rules\"\n\n\n\nLet Claude Code do what it does best – create comprehensive implementations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 2: Export for Review\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a git diff or summary of changes. Include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- The implementation code\n\n\n\n\n- Any UI screenshots\n\n\n\n\n- The intended functionality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 3: Codex Review\n\n\n\n\n\"Review this implementation for security, consistency, and correctness.\nAttached is [git diff/code/screenshots]\"\n\n\n\nWatch as Codex finds issues you never would have caught.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Step 4: Apply Improvements (Two Options)\n\n\n\n\nOption A: Ask Claude Code to apply the fixes\n\n\n\n\"Apply these recommended fixes: [Codex's feedback]\"\n\n\n\nClaude Code implements the improvements with full context of the original implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\nOption B: Ask Codex to apply the fixes directly\n\n\n\n\"Yes, please apply all the fixes\"\n\n\n\nCodex can handle both review AND implementation &#8211; as I demonstrated in this example.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth approaches work. \n\n\n\n\n\nChoose based on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Which tool has more context about your requirements\n\n\n\n\n- Your comfort level with each tool\n\n\n\n\n- The complexity of the fixes needed\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Why Claude Code & Codex Together Works So Well\n\n\n\n\n\n## Complementary Strengths\n\n\n\n\nThe Claude Code vs Codex combination leverages what each does best:\n\n\n\n\n\nClaude Code brings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Creative problem-solving\n\n\n\n\n- Comprehensive implementations\n\n\n\n\n- Deep context understanding\n\n\n\n\n- Rapid development\n\n\n\n\n\nCodex brings:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Meticulous attention to detail\n\n\n\n\n- Security vulnerability detection\n\n\n\n\n- Consistency checking\n\n\n\n\n- Edge case identification\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Pro Tips for Maximum Effectiveness\n\n\n\n\n\n## 1. Let Claude Code Explorer First\n\n\n\n\nAlways use Claude Code’s codebase-explorer agent for initial investigation. \n\n\n\nIt understands context better than starting fresh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 2. Be Specific with Codex\n\n\n\n\nDon’t just say “review this.” Say:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- “Check for security vulnerabilities”\n\n\n\n\n- “Verify integration points”\n\n\n\n\n- “Validate documentation accuracy”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 3. Screenshot Everything\n\n\n\n\nVisual proof helps both AIs understand what you’re building.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 4. Don’t Skip the Review\n\n\n\n\nEven if Claude Code’s implementation seems perfect, run it through Codex. \n\n\n\n\n\nThose “small” issues compound into big problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 5. Keep the Feedback Loop Tight\n\n\n\n\nApply fixes immediately while context is fresh. \n\n\n\n\n\nDon’t let reviews pile up.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## The Bottom Line: Claude Code vs Codex is the Wrong Question\n\n\n\n\nStop treating Claude Code vs Codex as an either/or decision. \n\n\n\n\n\nStart using them as collaborators.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Claude Code vs Codex debate misses the point entirely. \n\n\n\n\n\nThey’re not competitors fighting for your attention – they’re complementary tools that achieve greatness together.\n\n\n\n\n\nClaude Code is your brilliant architect who designs and builds. Codex is your meticulous inspector who ensures everything is perfect.\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, they don’t just write code – they craft production-ready solutions that are secure, consistent, and maintainable.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy newsletter shortcode went from “it works” to “it’s bulletproof” in one review cycle. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s the power of using the right tool for the right job.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour next feature deserves both the creativity of Claude Code and the precision of Codex. Why settle for less?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.S. &#8211; This workflow has become so essential that I now budget time for both implementation and review in every feature. The 30 minutes spent on review saves hours of debugging later. Try it on your next feature and see the difference.\n            \n\n            \n            \n            \n            \n                \n                                                            \n                    \n                        \n## Nathan Onn\n\n                        \n                                                    Freelance web developer.
