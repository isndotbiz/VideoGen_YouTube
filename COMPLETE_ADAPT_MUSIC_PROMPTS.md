## 🎵 ADAPT MUSIC PROMPTS (Step 2: Optimize Tracks) {#adapt-prompts}

After finding a track with search, use these in Labs Adapt → Adapt Music:

---

### FOR TECH TUTORIALS

#### Version 1: Ultra-Minimal (Maximum Voice Clarity)

```
Minimal ambient background texture with soft pad layers and gentle harmonic
drones. Very sparse arrangement with extremely low mid-range frequencies
(200-800Hz completely rolled off). No percussion, no melodic elements, no
rhythm section. Ultra-subtle atmospheric layers that sit far in the background.
Consistent gentle energy throughout with no buildups, no drops, no dynamic
changes. Soft high-frequency shimmer and deep sub-bass foundation only. Perfect
for continuous background presence that never competes with voiceover. Calm,
peaceful, barely noticeable.
```

**Best For:**
- Information-dense tutorials
- 90%+ talking
- Complex topics requiring full attention
- Professional educational content

**Expected Result:** Music at ~10% volume, nearly imperceptible

---

#### Version 2: Moderate (⭐ RECOMMENDED FOR MOST VIDEOS)

```
Smooth ambient electronic background with soft synth pads and subtle rhythmic
elements. Gentle filtered percussion with mid-range frequencies (200-800Hz)
significantly reduced for voice clarity. Light melodic movement in high
frequencies only. Consistent moderate energy throughout with no dramatic
buildups or drops. Minimal bass presence, focus on atmospheric textures. Smooth
transitions, even dynamics, background-friendly arrangement. Professional and
clean sound that supports voiceover without competing. Tech-focused, modern,
approachable.
```

**Best For:**
- Standard tech tutorials
- 70-90% talking
- Engaging but educational content
- YouTube tutorials, online courses

**Expected Result:** Music at ~15% volume, present but subtle

---

#### Version 3: Energetic (Noticeable Energy)

```
Upbeat electronic background music with steady rhythm and filtered mid-range.
Light percussion groove with muted frequencies between 200-800Hz to preserve
voice clarity. Bright melodic elements in high frequencies, subtle bass
foundation. Consistent energetic feel throughout with no sudden buildups or
drops. Smooth even dynamics, background-optimized mixing. Modern tech sound with
motivational energy that stays supportive of voiceover. Clean production with
space for dialogue, professional broadcast-ready balance.
```

**Best For:**
- Product demos
- Exciting tech announcements
- 50-70% talking
- Fast-paced tutorials

**Expected Result:** Music at ~20% volume, energetic but controlled

---

### FOR BUSINESS/CORPORATE VIDEOS

#### Version 1: Ultra-Minimal Corporate (Presentations)

```
Ultra-minimal background track for professional corporate presentation. Maximum
voice clarity - heavily reduce mid-range frequencies (200-1000Hz) where speech
lives. Remove all melodic elements that could distract. Keep only subtle ambient
pad in low frequencies (60-150Hz) and gentle high-frequency shimmer (8kHz+) for
polish. No buildups, no transitions, no dynamics - completely flat and
consistent. Extremely subtle, almost subliminal presence. Think elevator music
meets high-end hotel lobby. Voice must dominate 100% of the mix.
```

**Best For:**
- Boardroom presentations
- Training videos
- Webinars
- Executive communications
- 95%+ talking

**Expected Result:** Music at ~8% volume, nearly invisible

---

#### Version 2: Marketing/Explainers

```
Professional background music for marketing video with voiceover narration.
Reduce mid-range frequencies (250-800Hz) to create clear space for voice, but
keep moderate energy and movement. Maintain subtle rhythmic pulse and melodic
interest in high frequencies (3kHz+) and low frequencies (below 200Hz). Remove
dramatic buildups and drops - create steady, uplifting atmosphere instead. Warm
and trustworthy feel, but dynamic enough to maintain viewer engagement. Voice
remains primary focus, music supports brand personality without competing.
```

**Best For:**
- Product demos
- Brand storytelling
- Explainer videos
- Testimonials
- 70-85% talking

**Expected Result:** Music at ~18% volume, warm and present

---

### FOR MEDITATION/WELLNESS

```
Ultra-minimal, pure ambient bed with barely perceptible presence. Remove all
rhythmic elements, melodic lines, and percussive components. Create atmosphere
of absolute emptiness and silence with only the faintest sonic texture
underneath. Reduce all frequencies, especially 200-4000 Hz where voice guidance
will sit. Maintain only the most delicate pad layers. Target 15-25 dB RMS
maximum. Design for 60-90 second pauses of complete silence with narration.
Create a sonic void that supports stillness and meditation without any forward
movement or change.
```

**Best For:**
- Meditation guides
- Sleep content
- Wellness videos
- Yoga instructions
- ASMR with minimal voice

**Expected Result:** Music at ~5% volume, "Is there music playing?"

---

### FOR DOCUMENTARY/STORYTELLING

```
Cinematic underscore for documentary narration. Smooth orchestral or ambient
textures that flow continuously without dramatic peaks. Reduce mid-range
frequencies (300-800Hz) for narration clarity while maintaining emotional
warmth. Keep gentle movement and atmosphere but remove sudden crescendos or
diminuendos. Steady, contemplative feel with consistent emotional tone. Support
the narrative without overshadowing it. Think BBC nature documentary or TED
Talk background - present but never distracting.
```

**Best For:**
- Documentary videos
- Educational storytelling
- Historical content
- Science videos
- 80-90% talking

**Expected Result:** Music at ~15% volume, emotional support

---

### FOR VLOG/LIFESTYLE

```
Casual, organic background music with warm, authentic feel. Lo-fi aesthetic with
gentle beats and vinyl character. Reduce mid-range frequencies (300-700Hz) to
leave space for conversational voiceover. Keep laid-back groove and chill vibe
but make it subtle and supporting. Remove polished, overproduced elements -
maintain bedroom studio character. Smooth, flowing, relaxed energy throughout.
Coffee shop atmosphere that feels personal and relatable, never corporate or
aggressive.
```

**Best For:**
- Personal vlogs
- Lifestyle content
- Day-in-the-life videos
- Casual tutorials
- 60-80% talking

**Expected Result:** Music at ~18% volume, warm and casual

## 📖 EPIDEMIC'S OFFICIAL BEST PRACTICES {#best-practices}

### From https://www.epidemicsound.com/blog/how-to-use-adapt/

#### 1. Describe the Sound You Want (Not the Changes)
**Good:** "Tense, dark, and sophisticated jazz noir"
**Bad:** "Make it darker and more tense"

#### 2. Use Epidemic's Tags as Foundation
Start with their genre/mood/instrument tags, then expand:
- Genre: chillstep, minimal techno, corporate
- Mood: calm, energetic, professional
- Instruments: piano, synth pads, strings

#### 3. Use Emotive, Descriptive Language
**Good:** "Heavy & ponderous electric guitar with epic, cinematic mood"
**Bad:** "Guitar music"

#### 4. Specify Intended Use
Help AI understand context:
- "For podcast background"
- "For documentary narration"
- "For corporate presentation"

#### 5. Experiment and Iterate
First attempt may not be perfect - try variations

---

### Prompt Length Guidelines (from Epidemic):

**Simple (4 words):**
```
"Strings, dreamy, hopeful, chill."
```

**Moderate (22 words):**
```
"Heavy & ponderous electric guitar and synth, with an epic, cinematic mood,
in an industrial metal style."
```

**Advanced (50+ words):**
```
"A jazz noir style featuring upright bass plunging through sudden tonal shifts,
guitar coloring each modulation with sharp textures, sparse cymbal taps, and
saxophone lines bending like shadows across a streetlight. The mood is tense,
dark, and sophisticated."
```

**For voiceover content:** 40-70 words is optimal (detailed but focused)

## 🔑 KEY ELEMENTS IN EVERY GOOD PROMPT

Based on Epidemic docs + codebase analysis, every effective prompt should have:

1. **Role Statement:** "Minimal, background-friendly for [use case]"
2. **Frequency Instruction:** "Reduce mid-range frequencies (200-800Hz)"
3. **Energy Control:** "Keep [energy level] but make it subtle"
4. **Structure Modification:** "Remove buildups and drops"
5. **Consistency Instruction:** "Steady, consistent [quality]"
6. **Use Case Context:** "For voiceover narration" or "For corporate use"

**Missing any of these → Less predictable results**

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Always Mention "Voiceover" or "Narration"
Adapt's AI treats music differently when it knows voice is present

### Tip 2: Specify Frequency Ranges
"200-800Hz" is more effective than just "mid-range"

### Tip 3: Use "Remove" Not "Reduce" for Unwanted Elements
"Remove buildups" > "Reduce buildups"

### Tip 4: Describe the Sound, Not the Process
Good: "Smooth, gentle atmosphere"
Bad: "Make it smoother and more gentle"

### Tip 5: Always Enable Ducking in Adapt Length
The prompts assume ducking is ON - they're optimized for it

---
