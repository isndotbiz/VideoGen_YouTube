You want energy and tech vibes WITHOUT the music overpowering your narration. Here's how:

---

## 🎯 **NEW AI Prompt (Copy This):**

```
Fast-paced tech tutorial videos about AI and innovation. Need energetic,
futuristic electronic background music that complements voiceover narration.
Think minimal techno, future bass, or chillstep - electronic and modern but
not too aggressive. Instrumental only, with steady rhythm that doesn't
compete with speaking. BPM 100-120 preferred.
```

**OR** more specific:

```
High-energy AI/tech content with professional narration. Want electronic,
techno, or synthwave background music that feels futuristic and innovative.
Must be instrumental with consistent volume - no heavy bass drops or buildups
that overpower voice. Minimal techno, future bass, or electronic ambient
preferred. Modern, clean production.
```

## 🎧 **What to Listen For (Electronic Edition):**

### ✅ **GOOD Electronic Tracks:**
- Steady, driving rhythm (not chaotic)
- Bass is present but not overpowering
- Melody is clear but not distracting
- No sudden volume spikes or drops
- Clean, modern production
- You can still hear yourself talking over it
- Consistent energy throughout (no build-up → drop → quiet → repeat)

### ❌ **BAD Electronic Tracks:**
- Heavy bass drops every 16-32 bars
- Volume fluctuates dramatically
- Bass frequencies compete with voice frequencies
- Too many layers (sounds crowded)
- Aggressive, harsh sounds
- Makes you want to headbang (too distracting!)

---

## ⚡ **Quick Test Method:**

**While previewing each track:**

1. **Talk out loud** in your normal narration voice
2. **Can you hear yourself clearly?**
   - YES → Good track
   - NO → Skip it

3. **Does the bass interfere?**
   - If bass makes your voice hard to hear → Skip
   - If bass sits behind your voice → Keep

4. **Energy check:**
   - Energetic but background = ✅
   - Takes over the entire mix = ❌

---

## 🎚️ **Special Considerations for Electronic Music:**

### **Bass Frequency Conflict:**

Electronic music has lots of low-end bass. Your voice is mid-range.

**Solution 1:** Download with **Ducking Mix** (auto-reduces bass during voice)

**Solution 2:** When mixing, apply **High-Pass Filter** to music:
```python
# Remove frequencies below 100 Hz (where voice doesn't live)
from pydub import AudioSegment
music = AudioSegment.from_file("electronic_track.wav")
# This helps voice cut through
```

**Solution 3:** Choose tracks with **less sub-bass** (150-200 Hz instead of 40-80 Hz)

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Downloads for You:**

### **Start with These Genres (10 Track Mix):**

1. **4 Chillstep tracks** (energetic but smooth)
2. **3 Minimal Techno tracks** (steady driving rhythm)
3. **2 Synthwave tracks** (retro-futuristic vibe)
4. **1 Future Bass track** (uplifting, modern)

**Why this mix?**
- Chillstep gives you the "dubstep feel" without overpowering

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Electronic Music:**

### **Avoiding Bass Overload:**

1. **Preview with headphones** (bass is more obvious)
2. **Look for tracks labeled:**
   - "Minimal"
   - "Melodic"
   - "Atmospheric"
   - "Liquid"
   - "Chill"
3. **Avoid tracks labeled:**
   - "Heavy"
   - "Aggressive"
   - "Hard"
   - "Banger"

### **Finding Consistent Sections:**

Electronic tracks often have structure:
```
[Intro] → [Build] → [Drop] → [Break] → [Build] → [Drop] → [Outro]
  30s       15s      30s       20s       15s      30s      20s
```

**Best section to download:**
- **AFTER first drop** (around 1:00-1:15)
- **Duration:** 90 seconds from there
- **Avoids:** Quiet intro, dramatic builds, outro fade

**In Adapt tool, set:**
```
Start: 1:00 (60 seconds)
Duration: 90 seconds
Result: 1:00-2:30 (the "body" of the track)
```

1. **Test with actual narration first**
   - Don't download all 10 without testing 1-2

2. **Use Ducking Mix at HIGH intensity**
   - Electronic bass can overpower
   - High ducking = more aggressive reduction during voice

3. **Consider 2-track system:**
   - 5 energetic electronic (for fast-paced content)
   - 5 calmer electronic (for explanatory sections)
   - Mix and match per video segment

---

## 🔥 **Bottom Line:**

**Old recommendation:** Ambient/Corporate (60-80 BPM, very calm)

- Feel: Professional, educational

**NEW recommendation for you:** Chillstep/Minimal Techno (100-140 BPM, energetic)
- Good for: Fast-paced tech content, innovation topics
