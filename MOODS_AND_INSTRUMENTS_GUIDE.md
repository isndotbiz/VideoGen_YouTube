## 🎸 INSTRUMENTS EXPLAINED {#instruments}

### Best Instruments for Voiceover (200-800Hz Avoidance)

Human voice occupies **200-800 Hz** frequency range. Choose instruments that minimize this range:

#### ✅ EXCELLENT (Minimal Conflict):

**1. Synths (High-Pass Filtered)**
- **Frequency Range:** 1000-8000 Hz (above voice)
- **Why Good:** Modern synths can sit above voice range
- **Best Types:** Pads, leads, arpeggios (bright)
- **Avoid:** Bass synths, mid-range leads
- **Examples:** Chillstep pads, minimal techno leads

**2. Bass (Sub-Bass Only)**
- **Frequency Range:** 20-100 Hz (below voice)
- **Why Good:** Adds weight without competing
- **Best Types:** Sub-bass, 808s, sine wave bass
- **Avoid:** Mid-bass (100-300 Hz)
- **Examples:** Electronic bass, synth bass (low-passed)

**3. Ambient Pads**
- **Frequency Range:** Variable, but can be filtered
- **Why Good:** Atmospheric, fills space, can avoid mids
- **Best Types:** String pads, synth pads, drones
- **Examples:** Ambient textures, atmospheric beds

**4. High Percussion**
- **Frequency Range:** 2000-12000 Hz (above voice)
- **Why Good:** Adds rhythm without masking voice
- **Best Types:** Hi-hats, shakers, cymbals (light)
- **Avoid:** Snares (200-500 Hz), toms

---

#### ⚠️ USE WITH CAUTION (Moderate Conflict):

**5. Piano (Played High)**
- **Frequency Range:** 200-4000 Hz (overlaps with voice)
- **Why Caution:** Can compete in mid-range
- **Best Use:** High register (above middle C), sparse playing
- **Avoid:** Dense chords in mid-range
- **Mitigation:** Use ducking mix, keep volume low (10-15%)

**6. Acoustic Guitar (Fingerpicking)**
- **Frequency Range:** 80-1000 Hz (some overlap)
- **Why Caution:** Body resonance in 200-400 Hz
- **Best Use:** High-register fingerpicking, light strumming
- **Avoid:** Heavy strumming, bass notes
- **Mitigation:** EQ cut at 200-400 Hz

---

#### ❌ AVOID (High Conflict):

**7. Electric Guitar (Rhythm)**
- **Frequency Range:** 200-2000 Hz (major overlap)
- **Problem:** Power chords dominate 200-800 Hz
- **When OK:** Lead guitar (high register only)

**8. Brass/Horns**
- **Frequency Range:** 150-1500 Hz (direct conflict)
- **Problem:** Trumpet, sax, brass dominate vocal range
- **When OK:** Very subtle, background horn sections

**9. Male Vocals/Choir**
- **Frequency Range:** 85-350 Hz (fundamental overlap)
- **Problem:** Direct competition with narration
- **Solution:** Never use vocals with voiceover

**10. Snare Drums/Claps**
- **Frequency Range:** 200-500 Hz (mid-range snap)
- **Problem:** Each hit competes with voice
- **When OK:** Very sparse, light, or filtered
