- "for documentary narration"
- "for meditation guidance"
- "for vlog background"
- "for tech demos"
- "for explainer videos"

**How to Use:**

- Mention voiceover/narration if you have it
- This helps Epidemic's AI understand context

---

### Part 3: MOOD WORDS (Pick 2-4)

**Always Include One "Background" Word:**
- background ← ALWAYS USE THIS
- underscore ← Use for professional content
- minimal ← Use for subtle music

**How to Combine:**
```
Good: "background subtle atmospheric"

Good: "background peaceful calm"
Bad: "dramatic intense powerful" (conflicts with voiceover)
```

---

### Part 4: BPM RANGE (Make it narrow)

**How to Choose:**

1. **Think about your video pacing:**
   - Slow/contemplative → 50-65 BPM
   - Normal talking speed → 95-105 BPM
   - Energetic tutorials → 115-125 BPM
   - Fast-paced content → 125-135 BPM

2. **Make the range NARROW (10-15 BPM):**
   - Good: "115-125 BPM" (10 BPM range)
   - Good: "95-105 BPM" (10 BPM range)
   - Too broad: "110-130 BPM" (20 BPM range)
   - Too broad: "100-140 BPM" (40 BPM range)

3. **Popular BPM Ranges:**
   - 50-65 BPM → Meditation/Sleep
   - 65-80 BPM → Documentary/Story
   - 85-100 BPM → Vlog/Casual
   - 95-105 BPM → Corporate/Professional
   - 115-125 BPM → Tech/Tutorial
   - 125-135 BPM → Upbeat/Marketing

**How to Use:**
```
Write: "115-125 BPM"
NOT: "around 120 BPM" (be specific with range)
NOT: "fast tempo" (use numbers)
```

---

### Part 5: EXTRA KEYWORDS (Optional but helpful)

**Add These to Narrow Results:**

**For Maximum Consistency:**
- continuous
- steady
- flowing
- smooth

**For Minimal Sound:**
- minimal
- subtle

## 💡 PRO TIPS

### Tip 1: Start Specific, Then Broaden
- Try a narrow prompt first
- If < 10 results, remove one keyword or widen BPM by 5

### Tip 2: "Background" is Magic
- Always include "background" - it's Epidemic's semantic tag for voiceover-optimized music

### Tip 3: Test BPM Against Your Voice
- Record yourself speaking normally
- Tap along - what BPM feels natural?
- Use that BPM ± 10 in your prompt

### Tip 4: Genre Matters More Than Mood
- "minimal techno background" → Very specific results
- "electronic energetic" → Too broad

### Tip 5: Keep It Under 200 Characters
- Epidemic may truncate longer prompts
- Put most important keywords FIRST
