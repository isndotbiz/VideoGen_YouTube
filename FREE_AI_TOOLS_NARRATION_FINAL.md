**[INSPIRING, PROOF-FOCUSED TONE]**

**[5:00-5:15]** — CASE STUDY 1: THE FAST STARTER

"Let's look at real people making real money.

Meet Sarah. Three months ago, she started with ChatGPT and Midjourney.

She created Etsy listings for AI art and started a Fiverr gig writing content for small businesses.

Month one: Three hundred dollars. Month two: Eight hundred dollars. Month three: Two thousand dollars.

She's now hiring a part-time assistant to handle client emails."

---

**[5:15-5:30]** — CASE STUDY 2: THE AUDIO CREATOR

"This is James. He's been creating audiobooks with ElevenLabs and selling them on Amazon KDP Audio.

His first audiobook made thirty dollars its first month.

He kept creating. Now he has fourteen audiobooks live, making three thousand five hundred dollars per month in royalties.

Completely passive. He recorded the narrations once. Now they sell while he sleeps."

---

**[5:30-5:45]** — CASE STUDY 3: THE CONSULTANT

"This is Marcus. He's a Claude and Zapier expert. Started offering automation consulting on Upwork.

First client paid eight hundred dollars for automation setup.

Two thousand five hundred dollars in recurring monthly revenue. From automation consulting."

---

**[6:00-6:15]** — THE PATTERN

Different people, different tools, different streams. But the same outcome: Multiple income sources, legitimate money, real results.

None of them had special skills. None of them spent money upfront. They just understood that 2026 is THE year for AI income."

---

**[6:15-6:30]** — REALISTIC TIMELINE

"Here's the real timeline:

WEEK ONE: You pick your tools and start learning.

MONTH ONE: Your first fifty to three hundred dollars.

MONTH TWO: You scale what works. Five hundred to one thousand dollars.

MONTH THREE: Systems are running. One thousand to two thousand five hundred dollars.

MONTH SIX: Multiple streams active. Two thousand five hundred to five thousand plus per month.

YEAR ONE: If you stay consistent, conservative estimates say ten to forty thousand dollars from these free tools."

### SEGMENT 5: THE CHOICE (6:30-7:25) | 55 seconds

**[MOTIVATIONAL, CALL-TO-ACTION TONE]**

---

**[6:30-6:50]** — THE REALITY

"The barrier to entry has NEVER been lower.

These eight tools? All completely free.

The training? Free on YouTube. Free on Google. Free in Discord communities.

The technology? Available to everyone on the planet right now.

So what's actually stopping people from making money in 2026?

Time. Energy. Action.

That's it. That's the only difference between people making five thousand dollars per month and people making zero.

The people who succeed aren't smarter than you. They're not luckier. They're just taking action."

---

**[6:50-7:15]** — THE QUESTION

"So here's my question for you:

What's stopping YOU?

Is it doubt? Because the people in the case studies had the same doubt.

Is it procrastination? Because every person making two thousand dollars per month right now will tell you it started with one small action.

Is it not knowing where to start? Then START with ChatGPT. Create one prompt. See what it generates. Go to Fiverr. Create one gig. That's it.

You don't need permission. You don't need investment. You don't need it to be perfect.

You just need to start."

---

**[7:15-7:25]** — THE CALL-TO-ACTION

"So here's what I want you to do:

Pick ONE tool from the eight I showed you.

Spend fifteen minutes learning it today.

And tomorrow, start offering a service or creating a product.

That's literally how everyone making money with AI started."
