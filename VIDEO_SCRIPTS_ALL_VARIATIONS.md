## INTRO SECTION (0:00-1:00)

[VISUAL: Fade in title card - Claude Code vs Codex split screen]

"Hey everyone, thanks for clicking in. Today, I'm answering a question I get asked constantly: 'Should I use Claude Code or should I use Codex?'"

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[VISUAL: Show question mark animation]

"And here's the thing... you're probably asking the wrong question."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[VISUAL: Show VS comparison screen]

"After weeks of testing both tools in production environments, I discovered something that completely changed how I code. They're not competitors. They're not an either-or choice."

[VISUAL: Show interlocking gears/team collaboration]

"They're actually the perfect team, and knowing how to use them together is going to save you hours on your next project."

---

## THE PROBLEM: CODEX ALONE (1:00-3:00)

[VISUAL: Terminal showing sparse code]

"Let me start with Codex alone. Codex is fast. Really fast. You give it a prompt, and boom... it generates code instantly."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[VISUAL: Highlight the minimal output, show warning icon]

"But here's the problem. That speed comes with a cost. The code Codex generates is minimal. It's technically correct, sure, but..."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

"It doesn't handle edge cases. It doesn't include quality-of-life features. And when you ask Codex to understand WHY something works, or to debug across multiple files... [EMPHASIS: it struggles]."

[VISUAL: Show lonely code block in vast empty space]

"Codex has a limited context window. It can't see your entire codebase. So it generates code that works in isolation but breaks your existing architecture when you integrate it."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[VISUAL: Show tangled integration problems]

"You end up debugging integration issues that shouldn't exist in the first place. Codex is like asking for a house and getting a tent. It's shelter, technically, but it's not what you needed."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

---

## THE PROBLEM: CLAUDE CODE ALONE (3:00-5:00)

[VISUAL: Terminal overflowing with text]

"Now let's look at Claude Code alone. Claude Code is exceptional. It understands context. It explains its reasoning. It can debug multi-file problems."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"But—and this is important—all that thoroughness takes time. When you're writing a simple function, waiting for Claude to analyze your entire codebase and provide comprehensive context is overkill."

[VISUAL: Show complexity graph going up]

"This is where Claude Code falls into the over-engineering trap. Ask it to add error handling to a function, and it might create abstract factories, unnecessary design patterns, and 20 files when three would suffice."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[VISUAL: Show the file tree expanding endlessly]

"You don't need a research paper when you just want to close a div tag. And there's another issue..."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Claude Code requires context switching. It's not embedded in your IDE. So you're constantly breaking your flow—type something in VS Code, switch to Claude Code, copy the result back, rinse and repeat."

[EMPHASIS: For rapid iteration, this friction kills productivity.]

[VISUAL: Show developer switching between windows]

"So we have a dilemma. Codex is fast but shallow. Claude Code is deep but slow. What if there was a way to use them together?"

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

---

## THE SOLUTION: USING BOTH (5:00-7:00)

[VISUAL: Show interlocking gears - the solution]

"Here's the breakthrough: Use Codex as your implementation engine, and Claude Code as your strategic advisor."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[VISUAL: Show workflow diagram - Build, then Review]

"The workflow is simple. Use Codex in your IDE for rapid code generation. It stays in your editor, you stay in flow, and code gets written fast."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Then, when you hit the thinking parts—planning, debugging, architecture decisions—switch to Claude Code. Let it analyze, explain, and guide you."

[VISUAL: Show Venn diagram with overlap]

"Claude Code brings creative problem-solving and comprehensive implementations. Codex brings speed and IDE integration. Together, they cover every phase of development without gaps."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[VISUAL: Show the complementary strengths table]

"This isn't about choosing one or the other. It's about knowing when to switch and why."

---

## REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE (7:00-12:00)

[VISUAL: Show WordPress dashboard mockup]

"Let me show you this in action. Real project. Real workflow. I was adding a newsletter subscription feature to a WordPress theme."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"This isn't a simple task. It involves database schema, REST API endpoints, admin UI integration, and front-end components. Perfect test case for showing how this works."

[VISUAL: Show the feature requirements]

"Phase 1: Planning. I opened Claude Code and asked it to analyze my WordPress setup and plan the architecture."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[VISUAL: Show Claude Code analyzing code structure]

"Claude examined my existing codebase, identified where to integrate the feature, and explained the trade-offs. I got a complete implementation plan with file locations, database structure, and security considerations."

[EMPHASIS: This is where Claude Code shines. Thinking. Planning. Architecture.]

[VISUAL: Show the plan output]

"Phase 2: Implementation. Now I switched to Codex in my VS Code editor. I started following Claude's plan, and whenever I needed the next function... [PAUSE: 0.5 seconds] ...Codex autocompletes it."

[VISUAL: Show autocomplete suggestions in action]

"Codex generates the boilerplate, writes the API endpoints, handles the database interactions. Fast. Stay in flow state. No context switching. Just type and generate."

[VISUAL: Show code appearing rapidly]

"Phase 3: Debugging. About halfway through, something didn't work. An API endpoint was returning the wrong data, and there was an authentication issue."

[VISUAL: Show error logs appearing]

"Back to Claude Code. I pasted the error, the relevant code files, and my implementation notes. Claude traced the issue across multiple files, found the root cause, and explained exactly what was wrong and how to fix it."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[VISUAL: Show Claude's analysis]

"Not just a patch. An explanation. A fix that prevents the issue from recurring. This is Claude Code's strength—deep analysis and understanding."

[VISUAL: Show the before/after code comparison]

"The result? A feature that was secure, consistent, correctly integrated, and fully documented. Total time: about 30 minutes. Without this workflow? Maybe two hours, with way more back-and-forth and debugging."

---

## THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW (12:00-14:00)

[VISUAL: Show the decision framework flowchart]

"Here's your decision framework. It's simple. Ask yourself: What kind of task is this?"

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Planning, debugging, analyzing, refactoring strategy? Use Claude Code. Get the thinking work done. Get the plan right."

[VISUAL: Highlight Claude Code decision path]

"Writing code, implementing features, need autocomplete, doing routine work? Use Codex. Stay fast. Stay in flow."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[VISUAL: Highlight Codex decision path]

"The key is recognizing which mode you're in and switching tools accordingly. That's it. That's the whole system."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

---

## PRO TIPS (14:00-15:15)

[VISUAL: Show pro tips list]

"Now, a few pro tips to make this workflow effortless."

[PAUSE: 0.5 seconds]

"Pro tip one: Set up keyboard shortcuts. Make invoking each tool instant. Alt+Shift+C for Claude Code. Alt+Shift+X for Codex. Minimize friction."

[VISUAL: Show keyboard with highlighted shortcuts]

"Pro tip two: Use Claude Code to generate implementation plans, then paste them as comments in your IDE. Let Codex follow the plan you've already thought through."

[VISUAL: Show plan comments in code editor]

"Pro tip three: Keep Claude Code open in a terminal next to your IDE. Switch with a single Alt-Tab. It sounds small, but it matters."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"And most importantly: Don't skip the thinking phase. I know it's tempting to just ask Codex 'build me a feature.' But five minutes of planning with Claude Code saves 30 minutes of debugging."

[VISUAL: Show the time comparison]

---

## CONCLUSION (15:15-17:00)

[VISUAL: Show both logos together in harmony]

"Here's what you need to remember. The question isn't Claude Code or Codex."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"The question is: How do I use them together?"

[VISUAL: Show success checkmark with both tools]

"They're not competitors fighting for your attention. They're collaborators."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[VISUAL: Show the complete workflow summary]

"Pick one feature. Next time you code something. Use Claude Code to plan it. Use Codex to build it."

[EMPHASIS: You'll immediately notice faster development, fewer bugs, and better architecture.]

[VISUAL: Show call-to-action]

"Because you're finally using the right tool at the right time."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[VISUAL: Show subscribe/like reminder]

"Thanks for watching. If this was helpful, smash that like button. Subscribe for more workflows and productivity hacks like this. And drop a comment: which tool do you use more?"

[VISUAL: Fade out with YouTube end screen]

"See you next time."

# SCRIPT 2: SHORT VERSION (5 minutes - TikTok/Shorts/Reels)

**Speaking Pace:** 170-180 WPM (fast, punchy)
**Tone:** Energetic, engaging
**Format:** Vertical video with quick transitions
**Total Words:** ~900

---

## HOOK (0:00-0:10)

[VISUAL: Rapid text overlay "30 Hours of Code. 30 Minutes with AI"]

"I just watched AI automate 30 hours of work in 30 minutes. And here's the thing—most people are using the wrong tool."

---

## THE SETUP (0:10-0:45)

[VISUAL: Split screen - Claude Code vs Codex]

"There are two AI coding tools everyone talks about: Claude Code and Codex. People always ask me, 'Which one should I use?'"

[PAUSE: 0.5 seconds]

[VISUAL: Big question mark]

"Here's the problem: That's the wrong question."

[VISUAL: Quick montage of coding]

"Codex is blazingly fast. Generate code instantly. But it's shallow. Can't debug complex issues. Can't understand your architecture."

[VISUAL: Show minimal output warning]

"Claude Code understands everything. Explains it all. But it's slow. Over-engineers solutions. Overkill for simple tasks."

[VISUAL: Show the overflowing terminal]

"So what's the move?"

---

## THE SOLUTION (0:45-3:30)

[VISUAL: Both logos together with sparkles]

"Use them together. Seriously."

[PAUSE: 0.5 seconds]

[VISUAL: Animated workflow]

"Step 1: Planning. Ask Claude Code to analyze your codebase and plan the architecture. Takes 5 minutes. Saves 30 minutes of debugging."

[VISUAL: Show plan appearing]

"Step 2: Building. Switch to Codex in VS Code. Let it autocomplete. Fast. Smooth. Stay in flow."

[VISUAL: Show code appearing quickly]

"Step 3: Debugging. Hit a wall? Back to Claude Code. It debugs across multiple files. Finds root causes. Explains why."

[VISUAL: Show error being fixed]

"Codex is your hands. Claude Code is your brain. Together? Unstoppable."

[VISUAL: Show both tools working in harmony]

---

## REAL QUICK EXAMPLE (3:30-4:30)

[VISUAL: WordPress dashboard]

"Real example: Newsletter feature. Database schema, API endpoints, security, documentation."

[VISUAL: Rapid montage of each step]

"Claude Code: Plans it. 3 minutes."

[VISUAL: Plan appears]

"Codex: Builds it. 10 minutes."

[VISUAL: Code appearing]

"Claude Code: Debugs it. 2 minutes."

[VISUAL: Error being fixed]

"Total: 15 minutes. Without this workflow? 45+ minutes. Plus way more bugs."

---

## CTA (4:30-5:00)

[VISUAL: Big checkmark - BOTH, NOT EITHER]

"Try this on your next feature. Use Claude Code to plan. Use Codex to build."

[PAUSE: 0.5 seconds]

[VISUAL: Subscribe button animation]

"You'll never code the same way again."

[VISUAL: Quick brand/outro]

"Thanks for watching!"

# SCRIPT 3: PRESENTATION VERSION (10 minutes - Webinar/Talk)

**Speaking Pace:** 130-140 WPM (slower, conversational)
**Tone:** Educational, engaging, presenter
**Format:** Live presentation with slides
**Total Words:** ~1,400

## OPENING (0:00-1:00)

[CLICK: Slide 1 - Title]

"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Thank you for being here. I want to ask you a question, and I'm curious how many of you have faced this dilemma."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds - let people think]

"You're in the middle of a coding project. You need AI assistance. You have multiple options: Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot. Which one do you reach for?"

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[CLICK: Slide 2 - The Question]

"Most people choose one and stick with it. But after months of testing both in production environments, I discovered something that changed everything."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"They're not competitors. They're meant to work together."

---

## SETTING THE STAGE (1:00-2:30)

[CLICK: Slide 3 - Codex Profile]

"Let's talk about Codex first. Codex is incredible at one thing: speed. You give it a prompt, and boom—code appears instantly. It's embedded in your IDE. You stay in flow state. You stay productive."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"But—and there's always a but—Codex has limitations. It can't debug multi-file issues. It can't explain architectural decisions. It can't see your entire codebase. Limited context window."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[CLICK: Slide 4 - Codex Limitations]

"So you end up with code that works in isolation but breaks when integrated. You get edge cases you didn't anticipate."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[CLICK: Slide 5 - Claude Code Profile]

"Now Claude Code. Claude Code is the opposite. It's phenomenal at understanding. It can analyze your entire codebase. It explains trade-offs. It debugs across multiple files. It understands architecture."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"But it's slow. All that analysis takes time. And it tends to over-engineer. Ask it to add a simple feature, and it might create unnecessary abstractions."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[CLICK: Slide 6 - Claude Code Limitations]

"Plus, it requires context switching. You're not writing code while you're thinking with Claude. You're breaking your flow constantly."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

---

## THE INSIGHT (2:30-4:00)

[CLICK: Slide 7 - The Question Redux]

"So here's the insight: What if the question isn't 'which one should I use'? What if the question is 'when should I use each one'?"

[PAUSE: 2 seconds - let it sink in]

[CLICK: Slide 8 - The Workflow]

"The workflow is simple. There are three phases to any development task."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Phase one: Planning and architecture. This is thinking work. Analysis. Strategic decisions. This is Claude Code's strength."

[VISUAL CLICK: Highlight planning phase]

"Phase two: Implementation. Actually writing the code. Building the feature. This is Codex's strength. Keep it in your IDE, use autocomplete, stay fast."

[VISUAL CLICK: Highlight implementation phase]

"Phase three: Debugging and refinement. When something doesn't work. When you need to trace issues across your codebase. Back to Claude Code."

[VISUAL CLICK: Highlight debugging phase]

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"The key insight: Different phases require different tools."

---

## PROVING IT WORKS (4:00-7:30)

[CLICK: Slide 9 - Real Project]

"Let me show you this with a real project. A WordPress newsletter subscription feature. Not trivial. Involves database schema, REST API endpoints, admin UI, front-end components, security considerations."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[CLICK: Slide 10 - Phase 1: Planning]

"Phase 1: Planning. I opened Claude Code and asked it to analyze my WordPress installation and propose a newsletter architecture."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"What I got back: A complete breakdown of where to integrate, what database tables to create, security considerations, and how to integrate with existing systems."

[VISUAL: Show planning notes]

"This took 5 minutes and saved me 30 minutes of wrong decisions and rework."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[CLICK: Slide 11 - Phase 2: Implementation]

"Phase 2: Implementation. I switched to my IDE with Codex activated. Started writing the functions. Codex autocompleted everything based on the plan."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Database queries, REST endpoints, form validation. Fast. Smooth. No context switching. Just code appearing as I typed."

[VISUAL: Show autocomplete in action]

"10 minutes. Feature mostly built. I'm still in flow state."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[CLICK: Slide 12 - Phase 3: Debugging]

"Phase 3: Debugging. I tested it. Something was broken. An API endpoint was returning the wrong data format, and there was an authentication issue."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Back to Claude Code. I pasted the error logs, the relevant code files, and asked it to trace the issue."

[VISUAL: Show the debugging process]

"Claude analyzed across multiple files, found the root cause, explained what was wrong, and suggested a fix that prevents the issue from recurring."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Not just a patch. An understanding of why it happened."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[CLICK: Slide 13 - Results]

"Total time: 15-20 minutes. Without this workflow? 45+ minutes, plus more bugs, plus less understanding of why things worked."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"And the code was better. More secure. Better integrated. Better documented."

---

## FRAMEWORK (7:30-9:00)

[CLICK: Slide 14 - Decision Framework]

"So here's your decision framework. It's simple. When you sit down to code, ask yourself: What kind of task is this?"

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[CLICK: Show left side - Planning/Debugging]

"Planning, architecture, debugging, refactoring strategy? Use Claude Code. Get the thinking done first."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[CLICK: Show right side - Writing Code]

"Writing code, implementing features, routine work, need autocomplete? Use Codex. Stay fast. Stay in flow."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"That's it. That's the framework. Recognize the task type. Pick the right tool."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[CLICK: Slide 15 - Pro Tips]

"Quick pro tips. Set up keyboard shortcuts to switch between them instantly. Keep Claude Code in a terminal. Use Alt-Tab to switch. Minimize friction. And don't skip the thinking phase."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"I know you're tempted to just ask Codex 'build me this feature.' But five minutes of planning with Claude Code saves 30 minutes of debugging."

---

## CLOSING (9:00-10:00)

[CLICK: Slide 16 - Call to Action]

"So here's what I want you to do. Next feature you build. Use Claude Code to plan it. Use Codex to build it."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Notice the difference. Faster development. Fewer bugs. Better architecture."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

[CLICK: Slide 17 - Conclusion]

"Because you're using the right tool at the right time."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

"Questions?"

# SCRIPT 4: PODCAST VERSION (12 minutes - Audio Only)

**Speaking Pace:** 145-155 WPM (conversational, storytelling)
**Tone:** Warm, engaging, intimate audio
**Format:** Audio-only, no visual references
**Total Words:** ~1,800

---

## COLD OPEN (0:00-0:30)

[AUDIO CUE: Upbeat but professional background music fades in]

"Welcome back to The Code Brief, the podcast where we explore the tools and workflows that make developers faster and happier."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"I'm your host, [Your Name], and today I want to talk about something that almost every developer gets wrong."

[AUDIO CUE: Music fades to background level]

"It's a decision that seems simple but has huge consequences: Which AI coding assistant should you use?"

---

## THE SETUP (0:30-2:30)

[CONVERSATIONAL TONE]

"Here's what I've noticed. When I ask other developers which AI tool they use, they pick one and defend it like it's a sports team."

[CHUCKLE]

"'I'm a Codex person.' Or 'I only use Claude Code.' And they're missing something crucial."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"So let me ask you something. Have you ever noticed that when you're stuck on a problem, you need different kinds of help depending on what kind of stuck you are?"

[PAUSE: 1 second - let listener think]

"Like, sometimes you're stuck because you don't know what to do. You need someone to think it through with you. Whiteboard it. Explain the options."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Other times, you're stuck because you know what to do, but you just need to write the code. You don't want to think. You want to type. You want the muscle memory to take over."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"And sometimes, you're stuck because something broke, and you need to trace through everything and figure out why."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Those are three completely different situations. And here's the thing..."

[SLIGHT EMPHASIS]

"...AI tools specialize. Codex specializes in one thing. Claude Code specializes in something else. Most people don't realize this."

---

## INTRODUCING THE TOOLS (2:30-5:00)

[TONE: Educational but conversational]

"Let's talk about Codex first. Codex is lightning fast. You give it a prompt, and boom—code appears. It lives in your IDE as autocomplete. You stay in flow state."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"I love Codex for routine work. When I know what I want to write, Codex finishes my sentences. It's like having a really smart autocomplete that understands code."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"But here's where Codex struggles. Codex has a limited context window. It can't see your entire codebase. So when you ask it to build something complex that touches multiple systems, it can make decisions that work in isolation but break everything when integrated."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"And when something breaks, Codex is not great at debugging. It can't trace through multiple files. It can't explain the architecture that caused the problem."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

"Now Claude Code. Claude Code is the opposite. It's slow. All that analysis takes time. But it's thorough. It understands your entire codebase."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"You can ask Claude Code to debug a multi-file issue, and it will trace through everything, find the root cause, and explain it. That's amazing when you need understanding."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"But—and this is important—Claude Code can over-engineer. Ask it to add error handling to a function, and it might create abstract factories and design patterns you don't need."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"And it requires context switching. You're not coding while you're thinking with Claude. You're literally stepping out of your IDE, switching to a different tool, and breaking your flow."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

"So we have this interesting situation. Codex is fast but shallow. Claude Code is deep but slow. What if I told you there's a way to get the best of both?"

---

## THE REVELATION (5:00-7:00)

[TONE: Slightly more energetic]

"Here's what I discovered after months of testing: They're not meant to compete. They're meant to complement each other."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Think about it like this. Codex is your hands. Claude Code is your brain."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Hands are fast. Hands are dexterous. Hands can write code quickly once they know what to write."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Brain is slow. Brain does analysis. Brain understands architecture and debugging. Brain prevents mistakes by thinking things through first."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"What if you use them at the right time?"

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

"The workflow is three phases. Phase one: Planning. Use Claude Code to analyze your codebase and plan the architecture. Takes 5 minutes. Saves 30 minutes of rework."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Phase two: Building. Switch to Codex in your IDE. Use it to autocomplete the plan. Fast. Smooth. Stay in flow state."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Phase three: Debugging. Something doesn't work. Back to Claude Code. It traces through multiple files. It explains the root cause."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"That's it. That's the entire system."

---

## REAL EXAMPLE (7:00-10:00)

[TONE: Storytelling, personal experience]

"Let me tell you a story about a real project where this made a huge difference."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"I was building a WordPress theme, and I needed to add a newsletter subscription feature. This isn't a simple thing. It involves database tables, REST API endpoints for sign-up, admin UI for managing subscribers, front-end form validation, security considerations..."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"A lot of moving parts. So here's what I did."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"First, I opened Claude Code. I asked it: 'Analyze my WordPress installation and propose a newsletter feature architecture. Where should the code go? What database tables? How to integrate with existing systems? What security considerations?'"

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"And Claude analyzed my codebase. It looked at how my theme was structured. It made recommendations. It said, 'Here's where the database table should go. Here's the hook you should use for admin integration. Here are three potential security vulnerabilities to watch for.'"

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"That analysis took maybe 5 minutes. And it saved me from making like six mistakes that I would have discovered only after building half the feature."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

"Now, armed with a plan, I switched to my IDE. I activated Codex. And I started writing."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"I'd start typing the database query. Codex finished it. I'd start a REST endpoint function. Codex filled in the whole thing. I stayed in flow state. Just typing. Code appearing. Beautiful."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Built the entire feature in like 10 minutes. Now I tested it."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Something broke. The API endpoint was returning data in the wrong format, and there was an authentication issue. Classic integration problem."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"So I went back to Claude Code. I pasted the error message. I pasted the relevant code files. I said, 'This is broken. Figure it out.'"

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"And Claude traced through the code. It found that the hook I was using was firing in the wrong order. It explained why. It suggested a fix. And it suggested a pattern that prevents this exact issue from happening again."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Total time: 20 minutes. Feature: complete, secure, well-architected, integrated properly."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Without this workflow? 45 minutes to an hour. Plus more bugs. Plus less understanding of how it all works."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

---

## THE FRAMEWORK (10:00-11:30)

[TONE: Clear, authoritative]

"So here's the decision framework. When you start working on something, ask yourself a simple question: What kind of problem is this?"

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Is it a thinking problem? Planning, architecture, debugging, refactoring? That's Claude Code territory. Use it. Get the thinking done right first."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Is it a doing problem? Writing code, implementing features, routine work, need autocomplete? That's Codex territory. Use it. Stay fast. Stay in flow."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"The magic is recognizing which you're in and switching tools accordingly."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

"And quick pro tip: Don't skip the thinking phase. I know it's tempting. I know you want to just tell Codex 'build me a newsletter.' But five minutes of planning with Claude Code saves 30 minutes of debugging."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"It's not a linear workflow. It's a cycle. Plan. Build. Debug. Refine. And you use different tools for different phases."

---

## CALL TO ACTION (11:30-12:00)

[TONE: Warm, personal]

"So here's what I want you to do. Next feature you build. Next time you're starting something new. Plan it with Claude Code first. Then build it with Codex."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"Notice the difference. Notice how fast you move. Notice how fewer bugs appear. Notice how much better you understand the architecture."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"That's what this workflow gives you."

[PAUSE: 2 seconds]

[TONE: Warm outro]

"Thanks for listening to The Code Brief. I'm your host, [Your Name]. If this was helpful, subscribe, leave a review, and share this with a developer friend."

[PAUSE: 1 second]

"See you next time."
