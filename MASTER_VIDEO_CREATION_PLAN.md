## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

### For Flux Image Generation
- Be very specific with your prompts (they're already detailed)
- Use "steps: 30" for best quality
- Generate 2-3 variations if first attempt isn't perfect
- All images are yours to use commercially

### For ElevenLabs Narration
- Preview voices before committing to full narration
- "Anton" is great for professional content
- You get 10,000 characters free monthly
- Normalize audio if volume fluctuates

### For SpeedSketch Animation
- Don't animate all images - just key ones (8-10 max)
- Adjust animation speed to match narration pace
- Preview each animation before downloading
- Keep files organized with clear numbering

### For Canva Assembly
- Test export with just 2-3 clips first (5 min video)
- Make sure audio sync is correct before final export
- Use fade transitions (0.5 seconds) between clips
- Keep background music low (20-30% volume)

## ⚠️ COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

**"Images don't match my vision"**
→ Regenerate with adjusted Flux prompts
→ Adjust colors/styles in the prompt details

**"Audio is out of sync"**
→ Check narration timing in Canva
→ Adjust clip durations to match narration
→ Add pauses between sections if needed

**"Video looks pixelated"**
→ Make sure Flux images are 1920x1080 minimum
→ Export from Canva at 1080p, not lower

**"Video takes too long in Canva"**
→ Simplify: remove background music, reduce animations
→ Create shorter versions first (5 min) to test

**"Can't download from ElevenLabs"**
→ Make sure you're logged in
→ Try different browser if download fails
→ Check that free tier quota isn't exceeded
