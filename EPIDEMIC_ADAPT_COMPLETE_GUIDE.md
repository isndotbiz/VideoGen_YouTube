# Epidemic Sound ADAPT - Complete Guide for Your Use Case

## 🎯 What You Need to Know

Epidemic has **TWO Adapt features:**

1. **Adapt Music** = Changes the VIBE/MOOD of the track (AI regenerates instruments)
2. **Adapt Length** = Changes the DURATION (cuts to 90 seconds, adds loops, etc.)

**You'll use BOTH for your perfect background music!**

---

## 📋 **STEP-BY-STEP: How to Adapt Your Tracks**

### **STEP 1: Access the Adapt Tool**

1. Log into Epidemic Sound
2. Click **"Labs"** tab at the top of the page
3. Click **"Try Adapt"** button
4. You're now in the Adapt interface!

---

### **STEP 2: Select Your Track**

1. **Search for your track** (or browse from your previous AI search results)
2. **Click on the track** you want to adapt
3. Click **"Adapt"** button
4. **Track waveform appears** showing different sections (intro, verse, chorus, bridge, outro)

---

### **STEP 3: Adapt Music (Optional but Recommended)**

**This step makes the track MORE suited for background/voiceover use!**

#### **What to Do:**

1. Click **"Adapt music"** button (below the waveform)

2. **Describe the sound you want:**
   ```
   Minimal, background-friendly, consistent energy for voiceover use.
   Reduce mid-range frequencies, keep bass and synths subtle.
   ```

3. **OR select mood preset:**
   - Look for: "Calm", "Minimal", "Ambient", "Atmospheric"
   - **Avoid:** "Epic", "Intense", "Suspense"

4. **Select which stems to adapt** (dropdown menu):
   - **Recommended:** Select "All stems" OR just "Melody + Instruments"
   - This makes the entire track more background-friendly

5. **Add/Remove instruments** (right panel):
   - **REMOVE:** Aggressive drums, heavy bass
   - **ADD:** Synth pads, ambient textures (if you want)

6. **Click the arrow button** to process
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for AI to regenerate

7. **Preview the adapted version**
   - Listen to full track
   - Compare with original (click "View original")
   - If you like it → Continue to Step 4
   - If not → Click "Adapt again" and try different description

### **STEP 4: Adapt Length (CRITICAL!)**

**This is where you get your 90-second clip!**

#### **What to Do:**

1. Click **"Adapt length"** button

2. **You'll see preset options:**
   - 15 seconds
   - 30 seconds
   - 60 seconds
   - Custom (up to 5 minutes)

3. **Select "Custom"**

4. **Enter duration:**
   ```
   90 seconds
   ```
   OR
   ```
   1:30
   ```

5. **Choose which section to extract:**

   **Option A: Let Epidemic choose (Automatic)**
   - It will pick the best 90-second section

   **Option B: Manual selection (Better for consistency)**
   - Look at the waveform
   - **Drag the selection handles** to select the middle section
   - **Avoid:** First 30 seconds (intro) and last 30 seconds (outro)
   - **Select:** The steady "body" section (usually 30 seconds to 2 minutes in)

6. **Enable looping** (if needed):
   - If track is shorter than 90s, check "Loop to extend"

7. **Click "Adapt"** button
   - Wait 10-30 seconds for processing

8. **Preview your 90-second clip**
   - Listen all the way through
   - Check for consistent volume
   - Make sure it starts/ends smoothly

### **STEP 5: Download Your Adapted Track**

1. **Look in the "History" panel** (shows all your adaptations)

2. **Find your final adapted version:**
   - Should show: "Adapted music + Adapted length (90s)"

3. **Click the download icon** (top-right corner)

4. **Select format:**
   ```
   WAV (Recommended)
   ```

5. **Download!**

---

### **STEP 6: Organize Your Download**

1. **Rename the file:**
   ```
   {genre}_{mood}_{bpm}_adapted_90s.wav
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   chillstep_minimal_128bpm_adapted_90s.wav
   ```

2. **Move to folder:**
   ```
   D:\workspace\VideoGen_YouTube\background_music_epidemic\
   ```

## 🎯 **FOR YOUR SPECIFIC USE CASE (Tech Tutorials with Narration)**

### **Best Adapt Music Settings:**

**When you click "Adapt music", use this description:**

```
Minimal and background-optimized for voiceover content. Reduce mid-range
frequencies (200-800Hz) to make room for narration. Keep the electronic
energy but make it more subtle and consistent. Remove any dramatic buildups
or drops. Create a steady, hypnotic groove suitable for looping.
```

**OR use these mood keywords:**
- "Minimal"
- "Atmospheric"
- "Background-friendly"
- "Consistent"
- "Ambient"

### **Best Adapt Length Settings:**

1. **Duration:** 90 seconds exactly
2. **Section:** Middle of the track (around 30s-2min mark)
3. **Visual check:** Look at waveform - select the flattest section (consistent height)
4. **Avoid:** Sections where waveform goes from short to tall (volume changes)

## 💡 **PRO TIPS from Epidemic's Guide:**

### **Adapt Music Tips:**

1. **Describe the SOUND, not the changes**
   - ✅ GOOD: "Minimal, ambient, background-friendly"
   - ❌ BAD: "Make it quieter and less aggressive"

2. **Use Epidemic's own tags**
   - Check the original track's tags (genre, mood, instruments)
   - Use those words in your adapt description

3. **Apply emotive language**
   - "Tense, dark, sophisticated" works better than vague descriptions
   - For you: "Calm, focused, innovative, subtle"

4. **Specify intended use**
   - "For voiceover narration" or "Background music for tutorials"
   - This helps the AI understand context

5. **Experiment iteratively**
   - If first result isn't perfect, click "Adapt again"
   - Try slightly different descriptions
   - All versions save to History panel

### **Adapt Length Tips:**

1. **Manual segment selection = better results**
   - Don't rely on automatic
   - Visually inspect waveform
   - Pick the steadiest section

2. **Drag segments around**
   - You can rearrange intro/verse/chorus order
   - Create custom structure before adapting length

3. **Compare with original**
   - Click "View original" to hear difference
   - Make sure you're improving it, not making it worse

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTES:**

### **About Ducking Mix:**

**The Adapt guide does NOT mention ducking mix!**

- Ducking Mix might be a **separate feature** in the regular download section
- **Check for it when downloading** (not in Labs/Adapt section)
- If you see a "Ducking Mix" or "Voice-over Mix" checkbox when downloading → Enable it!
- If you DON'T see it → The Adapt Music feature might be adding some of this automatically

### **About Limitations:**

- **Adapt is in Beta** (Epidemic Sound Labs)
- Results may vary - AI isn't perfect
- Sometimes creates "artifacts" (glitches)
- If result sounds weird → Try adapting again with different description
- You can adapt **unlimited times** on Creator/Pro plans

### **About Stems:**

- You can choose which parts to adapt:
  - All stems (everything)
  - Melody only
  - Instruments only
  - Bass only
  - Drums only

- **For your use case:** Adapt "All stems" or "Melody + Instruments" for most consistent result
