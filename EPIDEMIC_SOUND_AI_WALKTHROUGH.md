# Epidemic Sound AI Tool - Complete Walkthrough

## 🎯 Your Video Description (Copy & Paste This)

Use this prompt in Epidemic Sound's AI Music Discovery tool:

```
I create educational YouTube videos about AI and technology. My videos are
fast-paced tutorials and tool reviews with professional voiceover narration.
I need background music that is calm, instrumental, and non-distracting so
viewers can focus on the narration and information. The music should feel
modern, tech-forward, and professional without being too energetic or
competing with my voice. Think ambient tech vibes, corporate innovation,
or relaxed lo-fi that enhances learning without overpowering the content.
```

**OR** shorter version:

```
Educational AI/tech tutorials with voiceover narration. Need calm,
instrumental background music that doesn't distract from the speaking.
Modern, professional, tech-forward vibe. BPM 60-80 preferred.

## 🎵 Selecting Tracks (What to Listen For)

### **Preview Each Track - Listen for These Qualities:**

#### ✅ **GOOD Signs (Keep It!):**
- Steady, consistent volume throughout
- Calm, flowing melody
- Subtle, non-distracting rhythm
- No vocals or vocal samples
- Modern, clean production
- You can imagine talking over it easily
- BPM 60-80 range
- Doesn't have dramatic intro/outro

#### ❌ **BAD Signs (Skip It!):**
- Volume changes dramatically (quiet intro → loud chorus)
- Heavy bass drops or build-ups
- Too energetic or fast-paced
- Vocals or vocal samples (even "ooh" or "ahh")
- Dramatic/epic feel (too much for background)
- Distracting melodies that compete for attention
- BPM >90 (too fast for learning content)

### **Quick Test:**
**Talk out loud while listening.** If the music distracts you from your own voice, skip it!

## ⚙️ Using the ADAPT Tool (Critical!)

Once you've selected tracks, customize them BEFORE downloading:

### **For Each Track You Like:**

#### **Step 1: Click "Adapt" or "Customize" Button**
- Look for button near download/save
- May be called: "Adapt", "Edit", "Customize", "Trim"

#### **Step 2: Set Duration**
```
Duration: 90 seconds (type "90" or "1:30")
```

**Why 90 seconds?**
- Perfect for looping (repeats at 1:30, 3:00, 4:30, etc.)
- Your narrations vary (30s-3min), 90s works for all
- Easy to loop seamlessly

#### **Step 3: Choose Start Point (Optional)**
- **Automatic (Recommended):** Let Epidemic choose
  - Their AI picks the best section
  - Usually avoids intro/outro automatically

- **Manual:** If you want specific section
  - Preview full track first
  - Note timestamp of best part (e.g., 0:45)
  - Set "Start at: 0:45"

#### **Step 4: Enable "Ducking Mix" (VERY IMPORTANT!)**

**This is the secret sauce!**

Look for checkbox or toggle:
```
☑ Ducking mix
☑ Lower music during speech
☑ Voice-over mix
☑ Narration-friendly
```

**What it does:**
- Automatically reduces music volume during voiceovers
- You don't need to manually set to 15% volume!
- Saves you mixing work

**If you see intensity slider:**
- Set to: "Medium" or "50-70%"
- This determines how much it ducks

#### **Step 5: Create Adapted Version**
- Click "Create" or "Generate"
- Wait 5-30 seconds for processing
- Epidemic creates your custom 90-second clip

## 💾 Downloading Tracks

### **For Each Adapted Track:**

#### **Step 1: Choose Format**
```
Format: WAV (Highest Quality)
```

**Why WAV?**
- Uncompressed, professional quality
- Better for mixing with narration
- No quality loss
- Industry standard

**Alternative:** MP3 320kbps if file size matters

#### **Step 2: Download**
- Click "Download" button
- Save to your computer

#### **Step 3: Organize Files**

**Recommended Naming:**
```
{genre}_{mood}_{bpm}_{duration}s.wav

Examples:
ambient_calm_65bpm_90s.wav
corporate_uplifting_75bpm_90s.wav
lofi_peaceful_70bpm_90s.wav
tech_modern_68bpm_90s.wav
```

## 🎬 Integration with Your Pipeline

Once downloaded, use in your video scripts:

```python
import os
import random
from pathlib import Path
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Your new Epidemic library
EPIDEMIC_DIR = Path("background_music_epidemic")

# Get all tracks
tracks = list(EPIDEMIC_DIR.glob("*.wav"))

# Random selection (for variety)
selected = random.choice(tracks)

# Load (already has Ducking mix enabled!)
music = AudioSegment.from_wav(selected)

# If Ducking mix is enabled, music auto-adjusts
# If not, apply -16dB manually
# music = music - 16  # Only if Ducking NOT enabled

# Mix with narration
narration = AudioSegment.from_mp3("narration.mp3")

# Ducking-enabled: Just overlay
final = narration.overlay(music)

# OR if music needs looping
music_looped = music * 3  # Repeat 3 times
music_looped = music_looped[:len(narration)]  # Trim to narration length
final = narration.overlay(music_looped)

# Export
final.export("final_audio.mp3", format="mp3")
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Can't Find AI Tool?**
- Try searching "AI" in Epidemic's search bar
- Look in "Music Discovery" section
- Use manual Theme filters instead (Technology/Educational)

### **No "Ducking Mix" Option?**
- May be called "Voice-over mix" or "Narration mix"
- Some plans may not have it - just download regular and apply -16dB manually
- Check in "Advanced options" or "Download settings"

### **Tracks Too Long/Short?**
- Adapt tool lets you set ANY duration up to 5 minutes
- Always use 90 seconds for consistency

### **Wrong Genre Coming Up?**
- Refine your AI prompt
- Add "no drums", "no vocals", "minimal percussion" to prompt
- Use manual filters instead

### **Can't Download WAV?**
- Check your subscription plan (some plans MP3-only)
- MP3 320kbps is acceptable alternative
- Contact Epidemic support if WAV should be available
