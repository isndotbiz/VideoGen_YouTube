# Adapt Music Prompts for Tech Tutorial Videos

These prompts are optimized for videos with voiceover narration. They focus on:
- Reduced mid-range frequencies (200-800Hz) for voice clarity
- Consistent energy without buildups or drops
- Ducking-friendly (auto-lowers during speech)
- Minimal percussion to avoid competing with dialogue

---

## Version 1: Ultra-Minimal (Barely There)

**Use Case:** Maximum voice clarity, music as subtle atmosphere only

```
Minimal ambient background texture with soft pad layers and gentle harmonic drones. Very sparse arrangement with extremely low mid-range frequencies (200-800Hz completely rolled off). No percussion, no melodic elements, no rhythm section. Ultra-subtle atmospheric layers that sit far in the background. Consistent gentle energy throughout with no buildups, no drops, no dynamic changes. Soft high-frequency shimmer and deep sub-bass foundation only. Perfect for continuous background presence that never competes with voiceover. Calm, peaceful, barely noticeable.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Energy: 1/10
- Voice interference: Minimal
- Best for: Tutorial content where voice is primary focus
- Ducking needs: Light (already very quiet)

---

## Version 2: Moderate (Present but Subtle)

**Use Case:** Balanced professional sound, music supports but doesn't distract

```
Smooth ambient electronic background with soft synth pads and subtle rhythmic elements. Gentle filtered percussion with mid-range frequencies (200-800Hz) significantly reduced for voice clarity. Light melodic movement in high frequencies only. Consistent moderate energy throughout with no dramatic buildups or drops. Minimal bass presence, focus on atmospheric textures. Smooth transitions, even dynamics, background-friendly arrangement. Professional and clean sound that supports voiceover without competing. Tech-focused, modern, approachable.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Energy: 4/10
- Voice interference: Low
- Best for: Standard tutorial videos with professional polish
- Ducking needs: Moderate (standard -6dB to -10dB reduction)

---

## Version 3: Energetic (Noticeable but Background-Friendly)

**Use Case:** Engaging content that maintains viewer energy while preserving voice clarity

```
Upbeat electronic background music with steady rhythm and filtered mid-range. Light percussion groove with muted frequencies between 200-800Hz to preserve voice clarity. Bright melodic elements in high frequencies, subtle bass foundation. Consistent energetic feel throughout with no sudden buildups or drops. Smooth even dynamics, background-optimized mixing. Modern tech sound with motivational energy that stays supportive of voiceover. Clean production with space for dialogue, professional broadcast-ready balance.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Energy: 6/10
- Voice interference: Moderate (requires proper ducking)
- Best for: Product demos, exciting tutorials, engaging content
- Ducking needs: Aggressive (-10dB to -15dB reduction during speech)

## Notes

- These prompts work with Epidemic Sound's Adapt Music AI generator
- Each prompt prioritizes voice-frequency preservation
- Ducking amounts are guidelines; adjust based on your specific voice
- For 30-second videos, all versions work well
- For longer videos (3+ minutes), Version 1 or 2 recommended to avoid listener fatigue
