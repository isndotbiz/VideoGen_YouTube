## ✅ RECOMMENDED STARTING PROMPTS

### For Your Tech Videos (Best All-Around):

**PROMPT 1:**
```
minimal techno background instrumental for voiceover tutorials ambient electronic
downtempo 115-125 BPM subtle atmospheric no vocals chillstep
```

**PROMPT 2 (if needed):**
```
show only tracks tagged underscore background ambient continuous steady avoid
dramatic energetic intense prefer minimal subtle flowing smooth
```

**Why This Works:**
- "minimal techno" + "background" = narrows to ~15-20 tracks
- "115-125 BPM" = very specific range
- Semantic tags: background, minimal, subtle, ambient
- PROMPT 2 uses only tags Epidemic recognizes

---

### For Corporate Videos:

**PROMPT 1:**
```
corporate minimal piano background instrumental soft tech underscore 95-105 BPM
professional clean subtle no vocals
```

**PROMPT 2 (if needed):**

## 💡 KEY IMPROVEMENTS

### What Makes These Better:

1. **"background" keyword in PROMPT 1** - Epidemic tags background-optimized tracks
2. **"minimal" keyword in PROMPT 1** - Filters for minimal production
3. **"subtle" keyword in PROMPT 1** - Semantic tag for gentle music
4. **"underscore" in some PROMPT 1s** - Professional background music tag
5. **Narrower BPM ranges** - 10 BPM instead of 20-30
6. **More specific genre combos** - "minimal techno" not just "electronic"
7. **NO duration mentioned** - Adapt cuts to 3 min anyway

### Result:
- **Fewer results** from PROMPT 1 (easier to manage)
- **Higher quality** results (better semantic matching)
- **Less time** reviewing tracks (15-25 instead of 40-60)
